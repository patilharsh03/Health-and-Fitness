                        <h1 class="display-5 fw-bolder">1. Walking</h1>
                        <p class="lead">Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Jumping jacks are a full body workout that can target major muscle groups, strengthen bones, and improve cardiovascular fitness and heart health.Neuro-transmitters that reside in the feet are rendered so sleepy as a result of shoe-filled, sedentary lives. Light impact is great to wake those crazy critters up. Like the walk-outs, the jacks, when performed with control, also work multiple muscle groups and get the heart rate up.”</p>

                        <p class="lead">A lunge can refer to any position of the human body where one leg is positioned forward with knee bent and foot flat on the ground while the other leg is positioned behind.Lunges are a good exercise for strengthening, sculpting and building several muscles/muscle groups, including the quadriceps (or thighs), the gluteus maximus (or buttocks) as well as the hamstrings.A long lunge emphasizes the use of the gluteals whereas a short lunge emphasizes the quadriceps. The lunge is a basic movement that is fairly simple to do for beginner athletes.</p>
